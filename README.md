Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Data Science Projects


AllLife_Customer_Segmentation_Project
Unsupervised Learning
- To identify different segments in the existing customer, based on their spending patterns as well as past interaction with the bank, using clustering algorithms, and provide recommendations to the bank on how to better market to and service these customers.
- Skills and Tools:  EDA, Visualization, Kmeans Clustering


BankChurners_Project_Catalfio
Feature Selection, Model Selection and Tuning
- To predict if a customer will leave the credit card services or not and the reason behind it
- Skills and Tools:  Cross validation, up and down smapling, regularization, Pipelines and hyperparameter tuning


Bank_Churn_ANN_Project_Catalfio_Final
Neural Networks
- To help the operations team identify the customers that are more likely to churn by building an artificial Neural Network from scratch.
- Skills and Tools:  Tensorflow, Keras, ANN, Google colab


CardioFitness
Fundamentals of AIML
- To execute preliminary data analysis by exploring the dataset and coming up with some basic observations about the data. Build customer profile to help capitalize based on it. Also, extract actionable insights that drive the sales of the business.
- Skills and Tools:  Pandas, NumPy, Visualisation techniques, EDA


Cars4U_Project_Catalfio
Supervised Learning: Regression
- Using the Cars4U dataset, need to come up with a pricing model that can effectively predict the price of used cars and can help the business in devising profitable strategies using differential pricing.
- Skills and Tools:  EDA, Linear regression, Linear regression assumptions, business insights and suggestions


Personal_Loan_Campaign_Project_Catalfio
Supervised Learning: Classification
- AllLifeBank dataset was used to build a model that will help the marketing department to identify the potential customers who have a higher probability of purchasing the loan.
- Skills and Tools:  EDA, Data Pre-processing, Logistic regression, Finding optimal threshold using AUC-ROC curve, Decision trees, Pruning.
